#Quick start for simple web projects
My personal boilerplate for web development based partially on Google's [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit) 

## Getting started
1. `npm install` to install the node dependencies
2. `bower install` to install the front-end dependencies
3. `gulp serve` to preview

## Distribution build
4. `gulp` to create the distribution build
5. `gulp serve:dist` to preview the distribution build
